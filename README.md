# Work in progress

Project piggybacking off of many tutorials on how to implement your own TCP/IP stack. The <br>
purpose of this project is to teach myself networking and systems programming while building <br>
off of some foundational principles. This project will serve purpose in implementing my own <br>
TCP/IP stack for my RPI-OS projects as well as a planned MQTT protocol clone project down the <br>
road. <br>

*This README will be filled out more as development progresses.*
